Below are two scripts for the Expected Collected and Collected Shipped report. 
expectedCollected.py
collectedShipped.py

For both files, at around line 15, there is a connection string that is used to connect to an SQL server. In the interest of data security, credentials such as the server address (SERVER), database (DATABASE), user ID (UID), and TRUSTED_CONNECTION have been removed.
To run this script, the connection string will need to have these parameters. Please type them into the brackets (<>) and delete the brackets as well.
Please have this script run on a schedule.
